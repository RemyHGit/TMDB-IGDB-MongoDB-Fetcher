# ContentAggregator
ContentAggregator is a project which fetch all the movies and series from the famous website **"TMDB"** and all the games from **IGDB**, store it to a docker's MongoDB database for further uses.

## How it works 
### Movies / Series
That project works as follow : getting public movies id ; which anyone can download, clean them, ask the TMDB and IGDB API for getting more details (useful ones), download every poster of movies / series / games if that's what you want and put all of theses data in a MongoDB database.

All that thing is working with threads, so fetching movies, series and games is simultaneous.

### Games
For games, we're using the IGDB API which requires Twitch credentials. The script fetches games in batches and syncs them to MongoDB with threading support.

### Automation with Airflow
The project is now automated using **Apache Airflow**. Each content type (movies, series, games) has its own DAG that runs daily to sync data from the APIs to MongoDB. There's also a `sync_all_sources` DAG that runs all syncs in parallel.

## How to run it

### Manual execution
Put that line in the terminal at the root of the project : 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run `plugins/main.py` and it should works. This will sync all sources (movies, series, games) using threads.

### With Airflow (Docker)
The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to run Airflow. Just run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then access the Airflow UI at `http://localhost:8080` (default credentials: airflow/airflow).

The DAGs available are:
- `sync_tmdb_movies` - Sync movies from TMDB
- `sync_tmdb_series` - Sync series from TMDB  
- `sync_igdb_games` - Sync games from IGDB
- `sync_all_sources` - Sync all sources in parallel

## Environment variables
You need to create a `.env` file with these variables:
```python
TMDB_API_KEY = "[your TMDB api key]"
MONGO_URI = "mongodb://mongo:27017/"
DB_NAME = "msg_db"
IMAGES_DIR = "images"
TWITCH_ID = "[your TWITCH_ID]"
TWITCH_SECRET = "[your TWITCH_SECRET]"
```

## Future for that project
Adjust the code so that you get what you want, like "i only want movies" ;  "okay, here we go:".

My goal for that project is to achieve a way on getting some data on anything from website legally and for everyone, hope it's going anywhere with that idea.
